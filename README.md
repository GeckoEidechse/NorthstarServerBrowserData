# NorthstarServerBrowserData
Data collected from polling `northstar.tf/client/servers` every 10 minutes

Note that the collected data is the raw response from the masterserver. Sanitising the response is not part of the data collection process. As such the `.json` files in the archives are not guaranteed to be actual JSON and can be HTTP/HTML error reponses instead, for example in cases when the masterserver was down.
